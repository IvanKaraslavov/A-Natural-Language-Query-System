An improvement to the system would be if a noun would be able to take
more attributes than one at once. For example instead of adding:
  John is a dog.
  John is brown.
we could simply type it as:
  John in a brown dog.

The system is quite ambigious sometimes. For examle long sentences like:
  Who likes a person who cooks and cleans?
could have two parse trees. The system cannot understand if we are looking
for someone who cleans and likes a person who cooks or we are looking for
someone who likes a person who cooks and who cleans. This ambiguity can be
removed for example with having a probabilistic context-free grammar applied
to the system. This way the system will know the most likely parse tree.

The negative word "not" can be added so that we could have negative sentences apart from 
the positive ones. 

We could extend transitive verbs in statements to handle not only proper nouns, but any noun phrase. 
Right now sentences like "John likes dogs" are not accepted by the system. So in order to improve this
we could change our system to accept non proper nouns or noun phrase, instead of returning the error 
"smth isn't a proper name". It will not be too hard to implement with the knowledge we have so far.
